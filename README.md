## 💡 What is Jeevan Setu?

**Jeevan Setu** is a role-based platform that securely connects organ donors and recipients through verified doctors and hospital networks. Built with a mission to reduce the delay and wastage in organ donation, it enables ethical, transparent, and medically prioritized matching.

⚠️ Less than **0.65%** of Indians are registered donors. Jeevan Setu exists to change that.
